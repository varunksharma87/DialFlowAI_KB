[Waive FAQs]
Waive is a compliance automation platform that helps accountants and Ass-ick agents manage their clients’ company obligations—without the admin nightmare. We automate everything post-registration: annual reviews, Ass-ick forms, reminders, director signing flows—so nothing slips through the cracks and late fees become a thing of the past. Think: zero admin, zero stress, total compliance.

Q: What forms can you lodge in Waive?
A: You can lodge Form 2 0 5, Form 3 6 1, Form 3 6 2, Form 4 8 4, and Form 6 0 1 0 via Waive.

Q: A company has already paid their Ass-ick balance. Why are they still receiving email reminders in Waive?
A: Please check the Annual Review tab in the company profile on Waive to ensure all directors have signed the solvency resolution and that your agent invoice has been paid. If everything appears in order, contact support for further assistance.

Q: A company has already paid Ass-ick, but the company balance in Waive is still showing as outstanding. Why?
A: Depending on how the payment was made, credit card payments can take up to 3 business days and bank transfers up to 10 business days to update in Waive.

Q: A form I lodged in Waive was rejected by Ass-ick, and I don't understand the reason.
A: When Ass-ick rejects a form, Waive will email you the reason. If the reason includes something like “invalid characters,” email support with the company name and we will correct and relodge the form for you.

Q: A company paid their Ass-ick invoices but still received a late fee. Why?
A: Check when and how the Ass-ick payment was made using the Annual Review tab in the company profile on Waive. If unclear, email support with the company name for assistance.

Q: My Waive 2FA isn’t working and I can’t log in.
A: Please email Waive support with your login email address and we will disable 2FA so you can log in.

Q: A Waive form is stuck on “Ass-ick Pending”. What should I do?
A: Sometimes Ass-ick validation can take a little time. If it’s been more than 24 hours, it might need an investigation. Would you like me to connect you with a team member to help with this?

Q: I deregistered a company in Waive but didn’t receive the \$49  Ass-ick invoice.
A: Ass-ick generates the debt immediately, but issues invoices on a fortnightly cycle. You’ll receive an email from Waive once the invoice is available.

Q: I submitted Form 4 8 4 to update a company’s registered address. Ass-ick approved it, but the address hasn’t changed in Waive. Why?
A: Ass-ick takes up to 7 days after approval for the address change to reflect. Please check again in Waive after this period.

Q: My client received an Ass-ick invoice and I don’t know what it’s for. How do I check this in Waive?
A: Check the second page of the Ass-ick invoice, which includes transaction details. You can also view this within Waive under the company profile.

Q: My client paid my agent invoice through their Waive director portal. Where does the money go?
A: Agent invoice payments made via the director portal are paid out to you every Thursday. A remittance is automatically emailed to the Waive account owner.

Q: What are the payment options for my client in the Waive director portal?
A: Clients can pay via credit card (instant processing with a 2% fee) or bank transfer (5 business days processing with a 1.5% fee).

Q: A company's renewal date has passed in Waive, but I haven't received the Ass-ick invoice. Why?
A: Ass-ick issues renewal invoices on the anniversary of company registration. If you were listed as the agent before the anniversary, the review should appear within 48 hours. If not, you may not receive the invoice. You can obtain BPAY details via the Ass-ick website to share with your client.

Q: Can I email PDF copies of Ass-ick forms and invoices from Waive to clients?
A: Yes. Go to Waive Settings > Notifications tab > Notification settings for Annual Reviews and Changes, and check the box to email Ass-ick invoice, Solvency Resolution, and Agent Invoice as PDF attachments.

Q: My client is getting an error accessing the Waive director portal from their annual review email. What should I do?
A: First, check that the contact is linked to the correct member in the Contacts tab of the company profile in Waive. Also, try accessing the portal via your agent copy. If issues persist, email support with the company name, director name, and error screenshots.

Q: A Waive client changed their email and mobile number. How can I update their details in bulk?
A: Go to the Members tab on the left menu in Waive, select “Members List”, find the client's name, and update their contact details on each contact card.

Q: How does the Waive subscription work? Is it monthly or annual?
A: The most popular option among Waive clients is a monthly subscription. With this model, you only pay for the companies actively under your management — not for any that have left your agency.

Q: How much does the Waive platform cost?
A: Pricing is best explained by a Waive team member. Let me check if someone in our team is available to walk you through the cost details.
